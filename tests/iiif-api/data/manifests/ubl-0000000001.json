    "description": "<div>The Ebers Papyrus is the largest, most beautiful, most important and only completely bequeathed scroll of ancient Egyptian medicine. The Ebers Papyrus is a unicum and the main source of knowledge about the old Egyptian medicine.<p><strong>Name:</strong> The scroll is named after its publisher, the Leipzig explorer and Egyptologist Georg Ebers (1837-1898).</p><p><strong>Acquisition:</strong> Georg Ebers purchased the papyrus scroll in Thebes (Upper Egypt) in the winter of 1872/73.</p><p><strong>Storage:</strong> The Ebers Papyrus is the property of the university library of Leipzig since 1873.</p><p><strong>Measurements:</strong> The scroll measures 18,63 m/20,37 yards in length and 0,30 m/11,81 inches in height.</p><p><strong>Age:</strong> The scroll originates in the last quarter of the 16th century BC.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> It is presumed that the Ebers Papyrus was found in a grave near Thebes.</p><p><strong>Script/language:</strong> The text is written in hieratic script, from right to left in black ink; red is used for headings and indications of measurements.</p><p><strong>Material and form:</strong> The Ebers Papyrus is a scroll consisting of 48 single papyrus sheets glued together. When discovered, the scroll was complete. For better conservation it was later cut into 29 pieces. Since the Second World War a few columns have been lost or damaged. In the presentation these columns are replaced by the facsimile produced by Georg Ebers in 1875.</p><p><strong>Content and structure:</strong> The Ebers Papyrus is a brief textbook of 110 columns about Ancient Egyptian medicine. Columns 103-110 were written on the backside of columns 102-94. On the back of column I there is a famous calendar which includes the date of the Sotis rising in the 9th year of the reign of Amenophis I (1525-1504 BC). The Ebers Papyrus contains 879 individual texts, describing about 80 different illnesses and their treatments. </p><p>More information in German and English under http://www.foyer-albertina.de <br /> <br /> &copy; Universit√§tsbibliothek Leipzig, 2016</p></div>",

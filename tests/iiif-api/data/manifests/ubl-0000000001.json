When discovered, the scroll was complete. For better conservation it was later cut into 29 pieces. Since the Second World War a few columns have been lost or damaged.

Columns 103-110 were written on the backside of columns 102-94. On the back of column I there is a famous calendar which includes the date of the Sotis rising in the 9th year of the reign of Amenophis I (1525-1504 BC). The Ebers Papyrus contains 879 individual texts, describing about 80 different illnesses and their treatments. </p><p>More information in German and English under http://www.foyer-albertina.de <br /> <br /> &copy; Universitätsbibliothek Leipzig, 2016</p></div>",
